# Ascii Animation Viewer
Small Python script for viewing ASCII art/animations.

## Features
- Adjustable frame rate
- Adjustable duration to display the animation for
- You can use colour codes for your pictures
- Display static art if you want

## How to Use

Import the ascii_animator.py module into your project

Make sure your ascii art is in its own .py file. Feel free to add multiple lists for different animations.

Import your art file if needed

Call ascii_animator.animate(ascii,framerate,seconds) to test your animations (or play them in your program if you like)

### To-do
- Might make it a bit friendlier for use outside of an IDE, but really it's just intended as a helper script for projects that might use ASCII art and need a quick way to check they animate correctly before pulling them into Unity or using them elsewhere.
